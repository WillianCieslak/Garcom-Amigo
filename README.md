# Garcom-Amigo
An android app developed for the final project at Dom Bosco University - Brazil.

The idea was developed in 2014, where customers could make their order using their own phones as long as they had
downloaded the app.
The app isnt funtional anymore (webservice and database conections were disabled).
All code is included, some parts are commented to enable to go through all the screens.
